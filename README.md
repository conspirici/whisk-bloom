## Features:

- **Generate Recipes**: Enter the ingredients you have, and the app will suggest a recipe you can create using them. No more wondering what to make with a handful of items!
- **Download Recipe**: Once you find a recipe you like, you can easily download it as a PNG image. Take it with you, or keep it handy for when you want to try it later.
- **Like Recipes**: Found a recipe that you love? You can like it! Though the app doesn't save your liked recipes persistently (because there’s no database setup), your favorites will stay saved for the current session so you can keep them in mind.
  
## How to Use:

1. **Enter Ingredients**: Start by typing in the ingredients you currently have. You can list as many as you'd like. 
2. **Get Recipes**: Hit the "Generate Recipe" button and let Whisk & Bloom suggest a dish you can make with those ingredients.
3. **Save or Download**: If you like a recipe, click the like button! You can also download the recipe as a PNG for later reference.
4. **Have Fun**: This app is meant for fun, so play around and see what creative meals you can discover with the ingredients you already have!

## Limitations:

- **No Persistent Storage**: Since the app doesn’t use a database, your liked recipes won’t be saved permanently. They’ll only remain available for the current session.
- **Basic Functionality**: This app is simple and designed to give you quick, fun results. It’s a great way to explore recipes, but not for full-scale meal planning.
- **Navigation**: The navigation is a bit messy at the moment, so don’t be surprised if you land on a 404 page. I’ll fix it when I get the chance, but for now, just keep exploring the features!

## Try it Out!

Whisk & Bloom is perfect for those moments when you want to cook something new but don't know where to start. Have fun exploring, experimenting, and getting creative in the kitchen! 🍽️✨
